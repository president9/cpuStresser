# cpuStresser
CPU stress test (WIP)

Project I am doing to learn about:
- concurrency + threading
- memory management
- os api
- solid principles

Todo:
- memory optimisations e.g. choose better containers
- better cpu stressers with more descriptive outputs
  - scaling with cache,ram and other stuff
  - image rendering
  - physics rendering
- gui
- windows + linux support

Currently a cli program. Want to make a gui.

Feedback welcome.
