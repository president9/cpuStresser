# cpuStresser
CPU stress test (WIP)

Project I am doing to learn about:
- concurrency + threading
- memory management
- os api

Todo:
- memory optimisations e.g. choose better containers
- better cpu stressers with more descriptive outputs
  - scaling with cache,ram and other stuff 
- upload code
- buy milk
- gui
- windows + linux support

Currently a cli program. Want to make a gui.
